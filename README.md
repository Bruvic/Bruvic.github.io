# MY VERSION CONTROL EXPERIENCE
## Version Control Is Awesome!
Being a member of DSC UNIBEN i was given a task to learn version control, A Software type have always have always been fascinated by. Starting off i had to learn how to use the command line, though i thought i had it all figured out it was a beautiful experience because i never knew i could create directories and delete files through the command line, at first i was like wow! Then i decided to take it all in. Still in the learning process i opened a GitHub account created a repository and learnt different Git commands, Commands like Git init, Git add, Git clone, Git remote push etc.

When i was done learning most of the basics i pushed forward to complete my task by forking the DSC repository, making a clone, making changes to the file i cloned and pushed it back to GitHub. it was fantastic. Now i understand better how software developers contribute to open source projects. And i canâ€™t wait to be part of the Great Contribution
